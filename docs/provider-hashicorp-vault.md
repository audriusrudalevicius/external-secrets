## Hashicorp Vault

External Secrets Operator integrates with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for secret
management. Vault itself implements lots of different secret engines, as of now we only support the
[KV Secrets Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv).

### Example

First, create a SecretStore with a vault backend. For the sake of simplicity we'll use a static token `root`:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      server: "http://my.vault.server:8200"
      path: "secret"
      version: "v2"
      auth:
        # points to a secret that contains a vault token
        # https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token
        tokenSecretRef:
          name: "vault-token"
          namespace: "default"
          key: "token"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vault-token
data:
  token: cm9vdA== # "root"
```

Then create a simple k/v pair at path `secret/foo`:

```
vault kv put secret/foo my-value=s3cr3t
```

Now create a ExternalSecret that uses the above SecretStore:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: vault-example
spec:
  refreshInterval: "15s"
  secretStoreRef:
    name: vault-backend
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: example-sync
  data:
  - secretKey: foobar
    remoteRef:
      key: secret/foo
      property: my-value
---
# will create a secret with:
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-sync
data:
  foobar: czNjcjN0
```

#### Limitations

Vault supports only simple key/value pairs - nested objects are not supported. Hence specifying `gjson` properties like other providers support it is not supported.

### Authentication

We support three different modes for authentication:
[token-based](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token),
[appRole](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle) and
[kubernetes-native](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes), each one comes with it's own
trade-offs. Depending on the authentication method you need to adapt your environment.

#### Token-based authentication

A static token is stored in a `Kind=Secret` and is used to authenticate with vault.

```yaml
{% include 'vault-token-store.yaml' %}
```

#### AppRole authentication example

[AppRole authentication](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle) reads the secret id from a
`Kind=Secret` and uses the specified `roleId` to aquire a temporary token to fetch secrets.

```yaml
{% include 'vault-approle-store.yaml' %}
```

#### Kubernetes authentication

[Kubernetes-native authentication](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes) has three
options of optaining credentials for vault:

1.  by using a service account jwt referenced in `serviceAccountRef`
2.  by using the jwt from a `Kind=Secret` referenced by the `secretRef`
3.  by using transient credentials from the mounted service account token within the
    external-secrets operator

```yaml
{% include 'vault-kubernetes-store.yaml' %}
```

#### LDAP authentication

[LDAP authentication](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/ldap) uses
username/password pair to get an access token. Username is stored directly in
a `Kind=SecretStore` or `Kind=ClusterSecretStore` resource, password is stored
in a `Kind=Secret` referenced by the `secretRef`.

```yaml
{% include 'vault-ldap-store.yaml' %}
```

#### JWT/OIDC authentication

[JWT/OIDC](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/jwt) uses a
[JWT](https://jwt.io/) token stored in a `Kind=Secret` and referenced by the
`secretRef`. Optionally a `role` field can be defined in a `Kind=SecretStore`
or `Kind=ClusterSecretStore` resource.

```yaml
{% include 'vault-jwt-store.yaml' %}
```

#### Nested data structures

If there is need to store complex values in vault you can use string parser and post process string with template engine if needed

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      server: "http://my.vault.server:8200"
      path: "secret"
      version: "v2"
      parser: "string"
```

And then you can access contents using .data
This example just dumps all aaa/bbb properties as json file

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
spec:
  dataFrom:
    - key: aaa/bbb
  refreshInterval: 600s
  secretStoreRef:
    kind: SecretStore
    name: vault-backend
  target:
    creationPolicy: Owner
    name: test-1
    template:
      data:
        config.json: |
          {{ .data | toString }}
```
